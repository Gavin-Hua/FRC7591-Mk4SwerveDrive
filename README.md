# FRC_Mk4_Swerve_Drive_7591
Swerve drive code for Mk4 modules, brought to you by team 7591
--------------------------------------------------------------
The two files here should be placed under the robot directory, through the path src/main/java/frc/robot, which can easily be found in the WPI VS Code.
The Robot file corresponds to the auto generated one, replace the latter with the former. The uploaded on contains only code for the swerve and nothing else, so other control systems needs to be added manually in the same file.
The Constants file is where most of the optimization should be performed.
See the comments for more tuning details,
Good luck!
